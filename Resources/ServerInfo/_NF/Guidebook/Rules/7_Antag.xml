# 7. Antagonism, PvP, and Piracy

Even bad guys follow their own rules.

    ## Antagonist Roles

    - When taking a ghost role, follow its set of rules unless told otherwise by an admin.
    -- Spamming ahelp asking for an exception will likely lead to a ban.
    - Non-antagonists must not work with antagonists and vice-versa.
    -- Non-antagonists include xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, space dragons, zombies and pirates.
    - Free agents may choose to work with non-antonists at their discretion.

    ## PvP

    - Follow escalation guidelines (see Rule 3) before attacking other players' shuttles.
    -- Neogiations must be attempted before boarding actions are started.
    - The crew of non-hostile vessels that surrender cannot be killed, left stranded, or completely bankrupt.
    -- The safety of non-hostile merchant vessels is to be guaranteed by all parties.
    -- Only the goods aboard a ship are valid plunder. All players' bank accounts must remain untouched.
    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, may be considered 'belligerent'.
    -- Belligerent ships may be boarded non-conventionally, and have their systems disabled in attempts to bring them to justice.
    - All suspects taken alive must be adequately cared for and unharmed according to Space Law.

    ## Piracy

    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members, including the Captain, sentient pets and cyborgs.
    -- Clarrrpy does not count towards this limit.
    - There may only be one Pirate Captain and one First Mate at any time.
    - As a pirate, you must have LOOC permission before kidnapping and holding any civilian hostage.
    -- People kept hostage cannot be forced to do labor under any circumstance.
    - Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews. This includes:
    -- Watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack.
    -- Pretending to be hostages.
    -- Knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.
    -- Joining in pirate activity or becoming a pirate.
