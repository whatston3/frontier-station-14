# 1. Community Expectations

Everyone here is playing to have a good time and have fun. Respect the rest of the players around you the same way you would like to be respected.

    - Follow these rules, both in-game and elsewhere in our community:
    -- Don't be a dick or harass other players.
    -- Do not push political messages of any kind in chat, images, drawings or faxes.
    - Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and SSD/catatonic players.
    - Do not respawn to avoid punishment from the NFSD, or respawn as the same character if given a permanent confinement sentence or execution.
